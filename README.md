# CS360-Inventory-App

Overview
The Inventory App is designed to help users manage their personal or business inventory efficiently. The primary goal of this app is to provide a simple yet comprehensive solution for users to keep track of their items, monitor stock levels, and manage inventory transactions. This app addresses the need for a mobile-friendly, user-centered platform that simplifies inventory management without the complexity of traditional software.

Features and User-Centered UI
To meet user needs, the app includes several essential screens and features:

Login and Signup Screens: Allows users to create accounts and log in securely.
Home Screen: Provides a dashboard overview of inventory levels and key metrics.
Item Management Screen: Enables users to add, edit, and delete inventory items.
Transaction History Screen: Displays a history of inventory changes and transactions.
Settings Screen: Allows customization of user preferences and notifications.
The UI was designed with a focus on simplicity and ease of use. By prioritizing a clean layout, intuitive navigation, and accessible controls, we ensured that users could quickly learn and efficiently interact with the app. The design choices were validated through user feedback, which confirmed that the app was both functional and enjoyable to use.

Development Approach
The development process followed an agile methodology, starting with a minimum viable product (MVP) and iterating based on feedback. Techniques such as modular coding, code reviews, and version control were integral to maintaining code quality and flexibility. This modular approach allowed for efficient debugging and feature updates. These strategies, particularly agile methodologies and modular coding, will be applied in future projects to ensure scalability and maintainability.

Testing and Quality Assurance
To ensure functionality, the app was rigorously tested through unit tests, integration tests, and user acceptance testing (UAT). Automated tests were used to check individual components, while manual testing was performed to assess overall user experience and catch edge cases. This thorough testing process is crucial as it helps identify and resolve bugs early, ensuring a smooth user experience. It revealed areas where the app could be further optimized and where additional features could be beneficial.

Innovation and Challenges
During the app's development, one challenge was creating a seamless user experience while handling multiple database interactions efficiently. To overcome this, we optimized database queries and implemented background threading for database operations to keep the UI responsive. This required innovative problem-solving and a deep understanding of Androidâ€™s architecture components.

Key Successes
One specific component where I demonstrated strong knowledge and skill was in designing and implementing the database management system using SQLite. By leveraging best practices for data storage and retrieval, I was able to create a reliable and efficient backend that supports the app's core functionality. This experience showcased my ability to integrate complex backend systems with a user-friendly frontend, which is critical for delivering a robust mobile app.
